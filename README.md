# 0xbtc-discord-price-bot
bot to monitor/post price etc to the 0xbtc discord server

Installation:
 - copy `template_secret_info.py` to `secret_info.py` and fill in your bot's authentication settings
 - Install python 3
 - `pip3 install websocket discord`
 - `python3 main.py`

Requires:
 - python3
 - websocket
 - discord

Todo:
 - occasionally APIs return NaN as a data point.. which is a valid float. Need
   to explicitly check for this.
 - keep a channel blacklist to prevent bot talking in certain channel ids
 - allow price command to show price of objects ie `!price lambo`
 - typos/new commands
   - !pools
   - !marketcap
   - !rank (to show cmc ranking)
   - !binance (to show current listing price in usd)
   - !private island (would be nice to store value with spaces and search for
     any matches that use underscores instead of spaces, or no spaces)
 - multiple quick commands will run in parallel, causing some things like 
   command counter to only count 1/2 commands. Results should really be pushed
   to a queue instead.
 - Need a new 'Pairing' class to handle pairings in a more generic way. This
   will allow easier integration of BTC pairings (ie mercatox)
 - volume_eth and volume_usd are not strictly defined - sometimes it means total
   volume across all pairs (converted to eth), sometimes it means volume in eth
   only and volume_btc means volume in btc only.
